To ensure the reliability, security and personalization of the website and the software I develop, I use Cookies. When you accept Cookies, this helps me improve the website by recognizing you, remembering your preferences or providing a personalized user experience.

## What are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files that a website may place on your computer or device when you visit a website. Cookies help a website or other website recognize your device the next time you visit. Web beacons, pixels or other similar files can do the same thing. I use the term "Cookies" in this policy to refer to all files that collect information in this way.

Cookies provide many functions. For example, they can help me remember whether you prefer dark mode or light mode and analyze the performance of my website.

Most websites use cookies to collect and retain personal information about their visitors. Most cookies collect general information, such as how visitors arrive at and use my website, the device they use, their Internet Protocol address (IP address), the pages they are viewing and their approximate location (for example, I will be able to recognize that you are visiting my website from Changsha).
